					<h1 class="themecolor">Tribyl Privacy Policy</h1>
					<h3>Updated December 20, 2018</h3>
					<p>At Tribyl Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tribyl”, “us” or “we”), we respect and protect the privacy of our website, www.tribyl.com, and our customers who use our website, sandbox environment, SaaS applications, tools, mobile apps and related services (together, the “Services”). This privacy policy explains how we use and protect our customers’ information and data as part of the Services.</p>
					<p>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Remember that your use of Tribyl’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use TERMS AND CONDITIONS, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>
					<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>
					<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
					<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. We do not collect any personal or billing information from you besides any data needed for the successful registration of an account. Through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect the following Personal Information:</p>
					<h4>Essential account data for user</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Username</li>
						<li>Password</li>
						<li>Functional team/Role</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Optional Account data for user</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Phone number</li>
						<li>Title</li>
						<li>Profile Picture</li>
						<li>Additional notification emails</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Connection Data</h4>
					<p>If you use our SaaS application, we will need access to emails, phone calls and CRM data for specific teams using our application. This information could include, but is not limited to, the UserID associated with the user in email, calls, or CRM, an access token necessary to access that service and any non-billing information you have permitted the third party to share or made public in connection with the third party service. Connection data is processed in order to provide application connectivity which is part of the Service.</p>
					<h4>Online form, email or chat data</h4>
					<p>If you fill out an online form to subscribe to updates from us, you voluntarily supply us with contact and other information that we may retain for any communication with you. Data from these sources are processed in order to supply you with information that you request from us and may be used for direct marketing and analytic purposes. You will always have the option to “opt-out” of this communication by emailing admin@tribyl.com . We will not contact you for promotional, marketing, or analytic purposes unless you fill out this online form and voluntarily provide us the requested information.</p>
					<h4>Support ticket data</h4>
					<p>When you submit a support ticket through our systems, we will collect company and contact data to record against your request. This is used by us in order to provide help to you in using the Services and to contact you about your request(s).</p>
					<h4>Information we automatically collect when you use our servic</h4>
					<p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our servers from your browser or device, which may include your login username and access token, your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Note that the access tokens or any such information is kept encrypted and never available to any usage except for administrators of our service.</p>
					<p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services—for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
					<h4>Customer Data</h4>
					<p>The Services depend on harvesting communications between your customers and yourself as you use the Services. In order to do this, some data about your customers (“Customer Data”) will be stored in our systems as enumerated below. This information is protected  using commercially feasible methods from interception, alteration and unauthorized access. You must ensure that you have the right to share such Customer Data with us under the same terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<p>We will not distribute or examine any Customer Data as provided in our Terms of Use TERMS AND CONDITIONS beyond what is necessary for providing the Services.</p>
					<p>The Customer Data may include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Job title</li>
						<li>Role</li>
						<li>Data such as emails, voice calls, documents and notes in connection with using your product or service and only in communication with you</li>
						<li>Any public information like LinkedIn or social media information</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Sharing of Data</h4>
					<p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
					<p>Information that’s been de-identified.  We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual and use that information OR information at an aggregated level within our service to improve our service. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>
					<p>Affiliated Businesses:  We do not share any information with any affiliated businesses except for any aggregated information only.</p>
					<p>Agents:  We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
					<p>User Profiles and Submissions:  Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p>
					<p>Business Transfers:  We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
					<p>Protection of Company and Others:  We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
					<h4>Browser extension</h4>
					<p>The application contains a browser extension made available through the Chrome (Google, Inc.) store. Chrome store may use your Google login information to allow the installation and usage of the extension. We do not keep any record of any information you provide to Google to get the extension. If this is not acceptable in your organization, we can provide alternate mechanisms to get this extension but it will not be as automatic as getting it from the Chrome store.</p>
					<h4>Security</h4>
					<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism, appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
					<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failures, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
					<h4>Access to Your Personal Information</h4>
					<p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Username</li>
						<li>Password</li>
						<li>Functional team/Role</li>
						<li>Phone number</li>
						<li>Title</li>
						<li>Profile Picture</li>
						<li>Additional notification emails</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@tribyl.com">admin@tribyl.com</a>.</p>
					<h4>Links to other Websites</h4>
					<p>The Services contain links to other websites, applications and content repositories which may be operated by other third parties. This may include carrying links to documents, images, audio clips and video files as they pertain to your usage of this information within your enterprise and any application/third party you are already using to store this information.</p>
					<p>If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>
					<h4>Choice</h4>
					<p>You can always decline to provide any information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us and we may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>
					<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by emailing us at <a href="mailto:admin@tribyl.com">admin@tribyl.com</a>. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
					<h4>Do Not Track</h4>
					<p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and service (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support “Do Not Track” requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>
					<h4>Children Personal Information</h4>
					<p>Since Tribyl is used by enterprise employees, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information or any data from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and to help enforce our policy. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe a child under the age of 13 may have provided Personal Information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@tribyl.com">admin@tribyl.com</a>.</p>
					<h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
					<p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@tribyl.com">admin@tribyl.com</a>.</p>
					<h4>Employee Access to Customer and Personal data</h4>
					<p>In order to provide the Services, reasonable and customary access to your data is available to our employees for the purposes of trouble-shooting, bug-fixing and providing help and support to you. Employees agree to this Privacy Policy as part of their employment with Tribyl, which restricts them from using any of your data outside of their normal working responsibilities. We constantly re-iterate this policy with our employees through training and online lessons.</p>
					<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
					<p>We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, but we will notify you of the changes by email, by posting a prominent notice on our site, or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. We encourage you to periodically review this document for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of our Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>
					<h4>Contact Us</h4>
					<p>If you have any questions regarding this Policy or about the privacy practices at Tribyl please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@tribyl.com">admin@tribyl.com</a> or at
